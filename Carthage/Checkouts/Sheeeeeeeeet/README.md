## <a name="about"></a>About Sheeeeeeeeet

Sheeeeeeeeet is a Swift library for creating custom action sheets. It comes with
many built-in components and can be extended with your own custom components.

Sheeeeeeeeet's action sheets can be styled to look like a `UIAlertController` or
a lot different. You can also customize how they are presented and dismissed.


## <a name="installation"></a>Installation

### <a name="cocoapods"></a>CocoaPods

To install Sheeeeeeeeet with [CocoaPods][CocoaPods], add this to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Sheeeeeeeeet'
```

### <a name="carthage"></a>Carthage

To install Sheeeeeeeeet with [Carthage][Carthage], add this to your `Cartfile`:

```ruby
github "danielsaidi/Sheeeeeeeeet"
```

### <a name="manual-installation"></a>Manual installation

To add `Sheeeeeeeeet` to your app without Carthage or CocoaPods, clone this repo
and place it somewhere on disk, then add `Sheeeeeeeeet.xcodeproj` to the project
and add `Sheeeeeeeeet.framework` as an embedded app binary and target dependency.


## <a name="basic-example"></a>Basic example

The most basic way to create an action sheet, is to specify items and the select
action, like this:

```swift
let title = ActionSheetTitle(title: "Select a value type")
let item1 = ActionSheetItem(title: "Int", value: 1)
let item2 = ActionSheetItem(title: "String", value: "Hi!")
let item3 = ActionSheetItem(title: "Car", value: Car())
let button = ActionSheetOkButton(title: "OK")
let items = [title, item1, item2, item3, button]
let sheet = ActionSheet(items: items) { sheet, item in
    if let value = item.value as? Int { print("You selected an int: \(value)") }
    if let value = item.value as? String { print("You selected a string: \(value)") }
    if let value = item.value as? Car { print("You selected a car") }
    if item.isOkButton { print("You tapped the OK button") }
}
```

To present the action sheet, just call any of its `present` functions, like this:

```swift
sheet.present(in: self, from: view, completion: ...)   // or
sheet.present(in: self, from: barButtonItem, completion: ...)
```

The `from` view is optional and is only used if the action sheet it presented in
a popover.


## <a name="advanced-example"></a>Advanced example

You can use Sheeeeeeeeet to create really basic action sheets like the one above,
as well as very competent and self-contained ones. The one above is just a start.
When you have the basics under control, check out [this example][AdvancedExample]
to see how you can take things one step further.


## <a name="item-types"></a>Item Types

Sheeeeeeeeet comes with many built-in item types, e.g. regular items, single and
multi-select items, links, collection-based items, custom items, buttons, titles
etc. For a complete list of item types, [click here][Item-Types].


## <a name="appearance"></a>Appearance

Sheeeeeeeeet lets you fully customize the appearances of action sheets and their
views and items. You can change fonts, colors and images as well as item heights
and even more stuff. For a complete guide, [click here][Appearance].


## Specifying items after initialization

If you require a created action sheet instance to resolve which items to present
(very common when you subclass `ActionSheet`), just create a sheet with no items
then call `setup(with:)` once its created.


## Example App

This project contains an example app that demonstrates basic and advanced action
sheet, as well as how to handle subclassing, appearances etc. Before you can run
it you must install [Carthage][Carthage] and run `carthage update --platform iOS`.
You can then open the project and try out the different sheets and item types.
