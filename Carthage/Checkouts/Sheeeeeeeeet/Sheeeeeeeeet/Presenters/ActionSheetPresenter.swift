 Action sheet presenters are used to present and dismiss any
 action sheet in different ways, for instance with a default
 slide-in, showing the sheet in a popover etc.
 
 Instead of a delegate, the presenter protocol uses an event
 property that has events that you can subscribe to, by just
 setting the action blocks in the event struct.
